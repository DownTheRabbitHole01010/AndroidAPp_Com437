** Project Description: **

An Android-based application designed to connect parents with local babysitters. Provides a secure platform where parents can easily find, vet, and hire babysitters based on their requirements. Incorporates social media verification for added trust and security.

** Problem Addressing: **

Challenges for Parents: Difficulty in finding trustworthy babysitters on short notice. Concerns regarding the safety and reliability of babysitters. Lack of clear and accessible reviews or references.

Challenges for Babysitters: Difficulty in finding babysitting opportunities. Absence of a unified platform to showcase their experience and credentials.

** Platform: **

Mobile Platform: Android

Support for Other Platforms in Future (Optional): iOS, Web Browser

** Front/Back-end Support: **

Front End: User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation. Separate sections for parents and babysitters to sign up/log in. Display of babysitter profiles with photos, reviews, and past experiences.

Back End: Database to store user (both parents and babysitters) information securely. Algorithms to match babysitters based on parent requirements. Integration with social media APIs for verification purposes. Rating and review system.

Functionality:

User Registration and Profiles: Parents and babysitters can register and create profiles. Babysitters can list their skills, experiences, and credentials. Parents can list their requirements.

Search and Filter: Parents can search for babysitters based on location, skills, ratings, etc. Advanced filters for specific needs, such as certified first aid training.

Verification System: Mandatory linking to Instagram and Facebook accounts. Verification badges for babysitters who have undergone background checks (can be a future addition).

Review and Rating System: Parents can rate and review babysitters after availing their service. Babysitters can accumulate and showcase ratings and reviews to attract more opportunities.

Chat and Communication: In-app chat system for parents and babysitters to communicate before finalizing bookings. Booking and Payment System (Optional): Parents can book babysitters and make payments through the app. Secure payment gateways integration.

Design (wireframes):

Landing Page: Options to sign up/log in as a parent or babysitter. Featured babysitter profiles.

Dashboard for Parents: Search bar and filters. List of babysitter profiles with quick view options. Shortlisted or favorite babysitters section.

Dashboard for Babysitters: Profile stats (number of jobs, ratings, etc.). Open job requests or inquiries.

Profile Page for Babysitters: Photos, bio, skills, and experiences. Reviews and ratings. Social media verification badges.

*The design phase will require in-depth wireframing for every individual page and flow of the application. Using tools like Figma or Adobe XD will help in creating detailed wireframes and prototypes.
